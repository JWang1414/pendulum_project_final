[x] Verify or refute that the period is independent of the initial angle
- Plot initial angle
- Find trend in data
- Periods appears to change for different initial angles

[x] Estimate the asymmetry of your pendulum
- Manual suggests has to do with the previous part
- So... see if a difference arises in the tau or period length?
- Relevant: Only used the amplitude on one side to minimize the effect of camera tilt/placement
- For both the symmetry trials, the periods are roughly the same, and follow the sam patterns
- Decay constants for both are also very similar, however the "direction" they break down for small angles is opposite
	- I cannot tell if this is because of symmetry, or simply coincidence

[x] Verify or refute the claim that the decay is exponential, and determine the time constant tau
- Plot the peak amplitude as a function of time
- Calculate the time decay for different initial angles
- Decay appears to be exponential
- Predictions of tau get chaotic when there are less datapoints

[x] Verify or refute the claim that the period depends on L as stated in the lab manual
- Units are wrong, we'll have to correct this
- Analyze datasets that alter string length. Use the small angle approximation to find an average period. Check if the period depends on L
- The period appears to vary depends on L, even for small angles
- Interestingly, for larger L, the period begins to scale quadratically

[x] Verify or refute the claim that the period is independent of the mass
- The mass might affect L and D. Ignore these parts
- Use the small angle approximation again. This time, analyze the datasets that vary mass
- Doesn't appear to be affected by the mass. For heavier masses, the period is longer on average, however, the affect is very small
	- Possibly has to do with stretching in the string

[] Investigate how L + D, m, and the initial angle on tau. If you find a trend, attempt to find a function which fits your data.
- Don't need a theoretical justification
- Need to justify function choice with goodness of fit or something similar
- There is nothing to verify or refute here
- Nothing to work off. Try using basic fit functions
- Ask for help

Consider design features and document decisions.
- I have written a document for this on Google Drive

More hints
- Apparently the angular dependence of the period and tau will change the rest of the experiment. Why?
- tau should be at least x20 larger than the period
- Find an experimental version of the small angle approximation for the pendulum (?)
- Power series a good to measure small deviations from a theoretical result
	- These hints grow progressively more unhinged
- The effect of mass on the pendulum is difficult to do well. Uncertainties must be very small
- It is best to change just one parameter at a time. Document this
